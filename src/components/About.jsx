                Hi there! I'm Diwas Mainali, a passionate third-year student at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), 
                pursuing my dream of becoming a full stack software engineer. With experience in web development, 
                including deploying a website for a research lab at the University of Sydney (USYD), I have honed my technical 
                skills and gained valuable insights into software development. Beyond academics, I enjoy challenging myself through 
                chess, staying active with tennis, and creating web applications that simplify everyday tasks.

                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="text-1xl py-4 px-4">
                I am a strong believer in continuous learning and collaboration, thriving on acquiring new knowledge and 
                working alongside like-minded individuals. I am always eager to engage with others, learn from their 
                experiences, and contribute my own perspectives to any project. If you'd like to connect, discuss opportunities, 
                or share ideas, please reach out to me at diwas.mainali1@gmail.com or through the social media links provided above.
                I am excited about the possibilities ahead and look forward to embarking on new challenges and collaborations.
